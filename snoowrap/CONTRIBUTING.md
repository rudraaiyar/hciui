## Making code contributions

**tl;dr contributions are welcome, make sure the tests pass, keep the linter happy**

Contributions are welcome. To contribute code, fork snoowrap and create a pull request.

Code style is enforced by [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) -- please try to make it pass without any warnings/errors. The ESLint configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/snoowrap/blob/master/.eslintrc.json), but it'll probably be easier to just copy the style of the surrounding code.

For bugfixes and new features, it's appreciated if you also add a regression test.

[This guide](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/snoowrap/blob/master/src/README.md) contains details on how to run the tests, as well as a general overview of the code.
